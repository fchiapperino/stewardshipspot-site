          <p>
            Many pastors and church leaders want to do major-gift conversations well—and they also want to avoid anything that feels like a shakedown.
            That tension is real.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you’ve ever thought, <i>“I don’t want to be weird about money,”</i> you’re not alone. The good news is that healthy major-gift invitations
            don’t require slick scripts or pressure tactics. They require <b>pastoral posture</b>, <b>clear vision</b>, and <b>simple follow-up</b>.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            The goal isn’t to “get a big gift.” The goal is to invite someone into aligned generosity—joyfully, freely, and clearly.
          </blockquote>

          <h2>First, redefine what a “major donor” conversation is</h2>
          <p>
            A major-gift conversation is not a sales pitch. It’s a <b>relationship conversation</b> that explores three things:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Calling:</b> What does this person care about spiritually and missionally?</li>
            <li><b>Capacity:</b> What could they do, if they chose to (without assuming)?</li>
            <li><b>Clarity:</b> What does your church need, and what would a gift accomplish?</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            When you treat it that way, you remove “weirdness” because you’re not trying to extract something.
            You’re trying to align vision and stewardship.
          </p>

          <h2>The three things that create awkwardness (and the antidote)</h2>

          <h3>1) Anxiety</h3>
          <p>
            Leaders often carry hidden anxiety into these conversations: <i>“If they say no, we’re stuck.”</i>
            People can sense that.
          </p>
          <p><b>Antidote:</b> do the internal leadership work first. Have a plan that does not depend on one person. Lead gifts accelerate a plan—they don’t create it.</p>

          <h3>2) Vagueness</h3>
          <p>
            Vagueness forces the donor to do all the mental work. “We’re trying to grow” doesn’t help them discern.
          </p>
          <p><b>Antidote:</b> bring a clear, concrete opportunity with a defined outcome.</p>

          <h3>3) Unclear follow-up</h3>
          <p>
            Most weirdness happens after the meeting: silence, uncertainty, or repeated nudges that feel like pressure.
          </p>
          <p><b>Antidote:</b> agree on next steps before you end the conversation.</p>

          <h2>A healthy posture: curiosity, gratitude, and freedom</h2>
          <p>
            Your posture sets the tone more than your words. Healthy posture can be summarized like this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Curiosity:</b> “Tell me what you’re passionate about right now.”</li>
            <li><b>Gratitude:</b> “Thank you for how you’ve served and given over the years.”</li>
            <li><b>Freedom:</b> “We’re inviting you to consider; there’s no pressure.”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            A scripture that supports this posture is <b>2 Corinthians 9:7</b>: giving is purposeful and free, not coerced.
            Your invitation should make that freedom feel real.
          </p>

          <h2>The simple structure: 5 moves for a great major-gift conversation</h2>

          <h3>Move 1: Begin with relationship, not the project</h3>
          <p>
            Start with genuine interest. Ask about family, work, and what God has been teaching them. Then ask a generosity question that opens a door:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>“When you think about your giving, what kind of impact do you most hope for?”</li>
            <li>“Are there ministry areas that especially have your heart?”</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Move 2: Share the vision in concrete terms</h3>
          <p>
            Use one sentence people can repeat. Avoid long backstory. Aim for clarity and steadiness.
          </p>
          <div class="card" style="box-shadow:none; background: rgba(15,45,63,0.05)">
            <h3 style="margin-top:0">One-sentence vision example</h3>
            <p style="margin:0">“We’re funding a 12-month project to replace critical HVAC and repair the roof so our kids’ spaces are safe, welcoming, and reliable every week.”</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Move 3: Offer an invitation (not a pitch)</h3>
          <p>
            The most important word in this moment is <b>open</b>. Open creates room for discernment.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>“Would you be <b>open</b> to exploring a lead gift that fits your passion and capacity?”</li>
            <li>“Would you be <b>open</b> to considering a gift in the range of ___ to help us move forward sooner?”</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            If you need to state a number, do it plainly and kindly. Don’t inflate. Don’t manipulate.
            And always connect the number to impact.
          </p>

          <h3>Move 4: Let them respond without rescuing the moment</h3>
          <p>
            Silence is not your enemy. Give them time. If they hesitate, you don’t have to fill space.
            Your calm communicates confidence.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If they say yes: thank them, clarify timing, and confirm next steps.</li>
            <li>If they say no: thank them, keep the relationship warm, and invite prayer.</li>
            <li>If they say maybe: ask what information would help them discern.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Move 5: Close with clear next steps</h3>
          <p>
            Weirdness often comes from ambiguity. Before you end:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Confirm a timeline: “Would it help to reconnect in two weeks?”</li>
            <li>Confirm what you’ll send: a one-page summary, project budget, or story of impact.</li>
            <li>Confirm the posture: “Thank you for considering—no pressure.”</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What to say when you’re not sure they have capacity</h2>
          <p>
            You don’t need to “qualify” someone like a salesperson. But you can invite them into a category of help without labeling it.
          </p>
          <div class="card" style="box-shadow:none; background: rgba(244,183,64,0.14)">
            <h3 style="margin-top:0">Low-pressure phrasing</h3>
            <ul style="margin:0">
              <li>“Some people are considering gifts at different levels. Would it be helpful if I shared the range we’re inviting?”</li>
              <li>“If a lead gift isn’t the right fit, would you still be open to a meaningful gift that feels joyful?”</li>
              <li>“Would you be open to helping us think through who might have a heart for this?”</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <h2>A simple follow-up plan (so you don’t chase people)</h2>
          <p>
            Here’s a follow-up sequence that is respectful and clear:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Within 24 hours:</b> a short thank-you text/email. (No extra info unless requested.)</li>
            <li><b>Within 3–5 days:</b> send the one-page summary and budget snapshot.</li>
            <li><b>At the agreed time:</b> one check-in: “Any questions as you’ve been praying?”</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If the person goes quiet, don’t punish them with repeated pings. Assume good intent, keep relationship warmth,
            and leave the door open.
          </p>

          <h2>Next Steps (do this this week)</h2>
          <ol>
            <li><b>Create a one-page opportunity brief:</b> the need, the plan, the number, and the impact.</li>
            <li><b>Make a list of 10–20 conversations:</b> people with alignment and relationship—not just perceived capacity.</li>
            <li><b>Schedule “listening meetings” first:</b> start with curiosity, not the ask.</li>
            <li><b>Decide your invitation language:</b> pick two sentences and use them consistently.</li>
            <li><b>Agree on follow-up rules:</b> who follows up, when, and how often (keep it simple).</li>
          </ol>
